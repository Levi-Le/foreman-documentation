= Verifying DNS resolution

Verify the full forward and reverse DNS resolution using a fully-qualified domain name to prevent issues while installing {Project}.

.Procedure

. Ensure that the host name and local host resolve correctly:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# dig localhost
# dig `hostname -f` # my_system.domain.com
----
+
When name resolution succeeds, the output resembles the following:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# dig localhost
; <<>> DiG 9.18.30 <<>> localhost
...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
localhost.		0	IN	A	127.0.0.1
...

# dig  `hostname -f`
; <<>> DiG 9.18.30 <<>> my_system.domain.com
...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
my_system.domain.com.			0	IN	A	XXX.XXX.X.XX
my_system.domain.com.			0	IN	A	XX.XX.XXX.X
----

. To avoid discrepancies with static and transient host names, set all the host names on the system:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hostnamectl set-hostname _name_
----

[WARNING]
====
Name resolution is critical to the operation of {Project}.
If {Project} cannot properly resolve its fully qualified domain name, tasks such as content management, subscription management, and provisioning will fail.
